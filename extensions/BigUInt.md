# `BigUInt`

## Properties
### `isSigned`

Multiplication switches to an asymptotically better recursive algorithm when arguments have more words than this limit.

### `description`

Return the decimal representation of this integer.

### `playgroundDescription`

Return the playground quick look representation of this integer.

This function calculates the result by [successively squaring the base while halving the exponent][expsqr].

[expsqr]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring

- Note: This function can be unreasonably expensive for large exponents, which is why `exponent` is
        a simple integer value. If you want to calculate big exponents, you'll probably need to use
        the modulo arithmetic variant.
- Returns: 1 if `exponent == 0`, otherwise `self` raised to `exponent`. (This implies that `0.power(0) == 1`.)
- SeeAlso: `BigUInt.power(_:, modulus:)`
- Complexity: O((exponent * self.count)^log2(3)) or somesuch. The result may require a large amount of memory, too.

### `power(_:modulus:)`

or `nil` if there is no such number.

[inverse]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm#Modular_integers

- Returns: If `gcd(self, modulus) == 1`, the value returned is an integer `a < modulus` such that `(a * self) % modulus == 1`. If `self` and `modulus` aren't coprime, the return value is `nil`.

- Complexity: O(count)

### `multiplyAndAdd(_:_:shiftedBy:)`

Multiply `x` by `y`, and add the result to this integer, optionally shifted `shift` words to the left.

- Note: This is the fused multiply/shift/add operation; it is more efficient than doing the components
  individually. (The fused operation doesn't need to allocate space for temporary big integers.)
- Returns: `self` is set to `self + (x * y) << (shift * 2^Word.bitWidth)`
- Complexity: O(count)

### `multiplied(by:)`

  `BigUInt.directMultiplicationLimit` words.

  `BigUInt.directMultiplicationLimit` words.
- Complexity: O(n^log2(3))

### `*=(_:_:)`

Multiply `a` by `b` and store the result in `a`.

### `isStrongProbablePrime(_:)`

Returns true iff this integer passes the [strong probable prime test][sppt] for the specified base.

[sppt]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_prime

### `isPrime(rounds:)`

Returns true if this integer is probably prime. Returns false if this integer is definitely not prime.

This function performs a probabilistic [Miller-Rabin Primality Test][mrpt], consisting of `rounds` iterations, 
each calculating the strong probable prime test for a random base. The number of rounds is 10 by default,
but you may specify your own choice.

To speed things up, the function checks if `self` is divisible by the first few prime numbers before
diving into (slower) Miller-Rabin testing.

Also, when `self` is less than 82 bits wide, `isPrime` does a deterministic test that is guaranteed to 
return a correct result.
